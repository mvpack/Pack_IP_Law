- Strategic claim development for complex technologies  
- Patent portfolio development and management  

## Artificial Intelligence & Software
- Machine learning and neural network technologies  
- Computer vision and image processing  
- Software, algorithms, and data-driven systems  

## Electrical Engineering & Physics-Based Technologies
- Signal processing and communications systems  
- Photonics and optical systems  
- Semiconductor devices and advanced electronics  

## Post-Grant & Opinion Work
- Inter partes review (IPR) and PTAB matters  
- Invalidity and patentability opinions
