# About Michael V. Pack, Ph.D.

I am a patent attorney with extensive experience representing clients in **highly technical subject matter**, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, telecommunications, medical imaging, and advanced electronics.

I hold a **Ph.D. in Physics**, an **M.S. in Electrical Engineering**, and a **J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center**, and I bring that interdisciplinary training directly into my patent practice.

Prior to entering private practice, I worked as a physicist at a U.S. national laboratory, conducting research in areas including quantum information, remote sensing, and radiation-hardened optical systems. This research background allows me to quickly identify the core technical contributions of an invention and translate them into clear, defensible patent claims.

In my legal practice, I have drafted and prosecuted **hundreds of patent applications** for U.S. and international clients and have experience advising on patentability, invalidity, and strategic considerations surrounding evolving subject-matter eligibility standards.
